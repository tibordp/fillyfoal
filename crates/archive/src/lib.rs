//! fillyfoal's dissectors for archives, compressed streams, disk images, partition tables and file systems.
//!
//! The `fillyfoal` crate registers them; use that.

// Dissectors name the core by its paths in the single crate they grew up in
// (`crate::cx::Cx`, `crate::formats::Input`): the core's modules are
// imported at the root, and `formats` holds this crate's families beside the
// core's plumbing and the families of the crates this one builds on.
